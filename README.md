</ol>
1- Create three new components: GameControl, Odd and Even
2- The GameControl Component should have buttons to start and stop the game
3- When starting the game, an event (holding an incrementing number) should get emitted each second (ref = setInterval())
4- The event should be listenable from outside the component
5- When stopping the game, no more events should get emitted (clearInterval(ref))
6- A new Odd Component should get created for every odd nember emitted, the same should happen for the Event Component ( on even numbers)
7- Simply output Odd - NUMBER or Even - NUMBER in two components
8- Style the element (e.g. paragraph) holding your output text differently in both components
